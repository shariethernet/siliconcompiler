Hardware Design Frontends
===================================

In addition to traditional hardware description languages like Verilog and SystemVerilog, SiliconCompiler also supports higher-level languages, for ease of hardware design prototyping.

Here are some tutorials of a few different types of high-level hardware design frontends:

* :ref:`Python-based frontends (Migen) <python-based frontends>`
  
* :ref:`chisel frontend`
  
* :ref:`C HLS Frontend (Bambu) <c hls frontend>`
  
* :ref:`bluespec frontend`

* :ref:`TL-Verilog frontend (Sandpiper)`
